# Expressions

Lab Objectives:
- Construct various types of expressions
- Use "terraform console" as development tool

## Lab

In this lab we will be using the “terraform console” command.  This opens the command line into a mode that allows you to type in expressions that are then evaluated.

Open Terraform console on the command line:

```
terraform console
```

At the “>” prompt, enter the following to see what they evaluate to.

#### Literal Values:

```
> 6.3

> ["foo", "bar", "baz"]   

> true    
```
